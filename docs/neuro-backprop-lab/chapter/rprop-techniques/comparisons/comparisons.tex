\begin{section}{Comparisons}
    \par The four distinct techniques proposed for~\glsxtrshort{rprop} are compared through a structured experimental workflow. Each technique is measured in terms of loss and accuracy.
    \par The loss function adopted is the cross-entropy loss:
    \[
        \sum_{n=1}^{N} - \sum_{k=1}^{c} t_{k}^{n} \ln y_{k}^{n}
    \]
    \par A total of $60,000$ elements was instantiated for the dataset, with $50,000$ allocated for the training set and $10,000$ for the evaluation set, using batch sizes of $5,000$ and $250$, respectively.\\
    The learning rate is set as $0.001$, the procedure was performed over $50$ epochs. A coherent configuration file varying on a specific~\glsxtrshort{rprop} version is:\\
