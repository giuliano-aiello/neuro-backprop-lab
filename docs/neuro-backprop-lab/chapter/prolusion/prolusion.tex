    \begin{section}{Goal}
        \par This report provides a comprehensive overview of a Python project whose goal is to develop and compare different adaptive backpropagation techniques involved in a machine learning process, as~\glsxtrfull{rprop}. \glsxtrshort{mnist} is the target of the learning model.
		\par The project follows the ``Empirical evaluation of the improved Rprop learning algorithms'' article by Christian Igel and Michel HÃ¼sken (2001).

	\begin{section}{Software Stack}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Python 3.9.6
			\item PyTorch 2.6.0
		\end{itemize}
		The project is equipped with a \texttt{requirements.txt} file which allows for seamless installation of dependencies, by executing \texttt{pip install -r requirements.txt}.

		\begin{itemize}
			\item \texttt{model} includes the neural network model architecture.
			\item \texttt{tester} handles the testing flow of the ready-to-use \texttt{<trained\_model>.pt}.
			\item \texttt{trainer} handles the examined backpropagation techniques and the training flow of the model, saving it as \texttt{<trained\_model>.pt}.
			\item \texttt{utils} offers utility functions designed to support the root project scripts.
